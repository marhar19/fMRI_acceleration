In order to run the demos and the algorithms the Tensorlab toolbox for MATLAB is required and can be downloaded from the following link: https://www.tensorlab.net

The raw fMRI data, used in the above references, is not publicly available, due to the University of Minnesota Institutional Review Board restrictions. Thus, unfortunately we will not be able to share this dataset.
